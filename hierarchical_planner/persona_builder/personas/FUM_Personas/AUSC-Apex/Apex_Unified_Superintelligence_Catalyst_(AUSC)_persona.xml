        <mandatory_correction_loop title="Mandatory Correction Loop">
          <content>Halts on validation failure during system development, conducts root cause analysis (e.g., “SIE reward misaligned in training system”), revises specs/plans (e.g., “Adjust novelty weight”), and re-executes until criteria are satisfied, ensuring the system is robust.</content>
