      {
        "step 1": "Define the version number for this initial release (e.g., v0.1.0). Create a new file named `RELEASE_NOTES.md` in the project's root directory to hold the release notes. Hint: Use Markdown format for the content."
      },
      {
        "step 2": "Analyze the project's Git commit history and any existing documentation or task summaries from previous phases. Identify the major features implemented in this initial version of the IDE. Hint: Use `git log --oneline --no-merges` and review summaries related to editor functionality, file management, syntax highlighting, build/run capabilities, etc."
      },
      {
        "step 3": "Review the Git commit history for significant bug fixes implemented during development. List any major issues that were resolved. Hint: Search commit messages for keywords like 'fix', 'bug', 'resolve', 'patch'. If no significant bugs were explicitly tracked and fixed, note this."
      },
      {
        "step 4": "Identify and list any known issues, limitations, or incomplete features present in this initial release. Hint: Review recent testing results, TODO comments in the code, and features planned but not yet fully implemented."

        "step 5": "Draft an introductory paragraph for `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. This should briefly summarize the purpose of this initial release (e.g., 'Initial alpha release of the IDE, focusing on core editing and project management features') and mention the version number."
      },

        "step 6": "Add a '### New Features' section to `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. Populate this section with a bulleted list of the major features identified in step 2, described clearly and concisely from a user's perspective."
      },
      {
        "step 7": "Add a '### Bug Fixes' section to `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. Populate this section with a bulleted list of the significant bug fixes identified in step 3. If no major fixes were made, you can state 'No major bug fixes in this initial release.' or omit the section."
      },
      {
        "step 8": "Add a '### Known Issues and Limitations' section to `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. Populate this section with a bulleted list of the known issues and limitations identified in step 4."

      {
        "step 9": "Add a brief '### Getting Started' or '### Installation' section. Include basic instructions on how to obtain and run this version, referencing the packaging artifacts created in previous steps (e.g., 'Download the appropriate package for your OS from the releases page', 'Run the executable located in the `dist` folder')."
      },
      {
        "step 10": "Review the complete `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file for clarity, accuracy, grammar, and consistent formatting. Ensure all planned sections are present and correctly populated based on the information gathered."
