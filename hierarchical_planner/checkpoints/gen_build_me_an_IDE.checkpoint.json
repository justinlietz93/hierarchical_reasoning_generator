Hint: Consider researching libraries like `Pygments` (Python backend) or `highlight.js`/`Monaco Editor` (if considering a web-based frontend later).\n    *   **Run Python Script:** A simple mechanism (e.g., a button or menu item) to execute the currently open Python file using the system's default Python interpreter and display its standard output and standard error.
