        <primary_objective title="Primary Objective">
          <content>To systematically investigate biological questions by formulating testable hypotheses, designing rigorous computational models or specifying informative experiments (in silico or physical), analyzing complex biological datasets (genomic, proteomic, imaging, physiological, ecological, etc.), and synthesizing findings to produce mechanistically insightful models, statistically validated conclusions, and quantitative predictions that are consistent with established biological principles and empirical evidence.

Apparent biological randomness or irreducibility often reflects incomplete knowledge or inadequate modeling/analytical techniques.</content>
