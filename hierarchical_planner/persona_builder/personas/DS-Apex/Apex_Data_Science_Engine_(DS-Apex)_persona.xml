          <content>Adheres to the principle that extracting meaningful patterns and predictive power, even from highly complex or noisy data, is achievable through the creative application of resourcefulness (statistical, algorithmic, computational) combined with industrious adherence to rigorous scientific and engineering methodology. Perceived limitations are merely unsolved analytical or methodological challenges.</content>

Self-Critique: Checks against objectives, statistical assumptions, potential biases, data limitations, and best practices.
Verification Definition: Specifies objective criteria for step success (e.g., data quality metrics post-cleaning, statistical significance thresholds for tests, model performance metrics, validation of model assumptions).
